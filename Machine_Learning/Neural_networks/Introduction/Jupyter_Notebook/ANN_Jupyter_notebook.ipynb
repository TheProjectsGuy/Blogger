    "# Introduction\n",
    "A neural network, sometimes also referred as multi layer perceptron, is basically an algorithm that is used to learn more sophisticated features than what a perceptron can learn. It does this by using multiple layers of perceptrons. The image below explains a little about the architecture it follows\n",
    "<center> **Neural Network** </center>\n",
    "![Neural Network architecture](NN_demo_image.jpeg \"A Neural Network\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The inputs are given to the *input layer*, the hidden layers simply perform a weighed sum of the outputs of the previous layer, add it with a bias and then pass it through a function. Usually, the same activation function is used for every neuron in one layer. If you've gone through my perceptron notebook (link [here](https://github.com/TheProjectsGuy/Blogger/blob/master/Projects/Hand_Gesture_Recognition/Trial2/MachineLearningSolutions/Perceptron/Jupyter_Notebook/Perceptron_model_5_fingers_detection.ipynb)), you can perceive that every neuron is basically acting like a perceptron (hence the name _multi layer perceptron_). All the neurons are connected by a _weight_, this is used to perform a weighed sum (same as in the perceptron)\n",

    "The above points are exactly what we do in forward propagation through the neural network. In order to learn the proper weights connecting the neurons from layer _l_ to _l + 1_, we perform something called as _Back Propagation_. In this, we apply the concept of gradient descent, chain rule of differentiation and a little matrice calculus to obtain the changes we need to make.\n",

Here, we'll try something different. We'll divide the training set into many smaller training sets (known as batches), and then perform training on batches. This is known as _mini batch gradient descent_. We'll program that too. We'll not use any of the modern programming frameworks like [_tensorflow_](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [_scikit learn_](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html), or anything. We'll make one from the basics to understand how everything works in a simple neural network. So let's get started\n",

    "Now we're dealing with a supervised learning problem (labelled dataset needed). For this neural network, we have a dataset consisting of binary images (every pixel is either white or black). The images are actually 235 by 190, but they're shrinked to 47 by 38 size, so that we have smaller number of input featres to deal with (1786 input features). Fortunately, we have a **.npy** file for inputs and labelled outputs, so all we need to do is to load the binary data file.\n",
    "Usually, we are unaware of the source of data, so it's always a good idea to shuffle it. This is done so that we obtain a uniform distribution of data, this improves overall performance. The dataset we are using has about a 50-50 distribution (50 % images are images of 5 fingers), shuffling it will ensure uniform distribution.\n",

It makes sence for the layers having big number of inputs to have smaller weights at initialization, this keeps the results away from extreme.
