A line basically needs 4 independent values, they could be 2 coordinate values and one angle and other length *or* the coordinates of the starting and ending points. In opencv, these four value are the coordinates of the two points (starting and ending) in the cartesian system. We use the `cv.line` function to make a line. Pass it the image that you'll be drawing on, starting and ending points, color, thickness, [line type](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.0/d0/de1/group__core.html#gaf076ef45de481ac96e0ab3dc2c29a777) and other properties. One important thing to note is that though the function returns an image with the line made on it, it actually makes the line on the passed image as well. So it's best to pass a copy of the image rather than the actual image to the function.\n",
