    "### Opening an image\n",
    "The function used to open an image in opencv is `imread(image_path)`. Pass it the image path. Here it's \"_Car1.jpg_\", so we'll use that. Note that the image must be defined at the image path, else the function will return **None**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important\n",
    "- The image you're importing using the `cv.imread` function must be in the same path as the script, basically it must be an accessible file physically stored in the same location as where you're python script is stored. If you import an image that doesn't exist, the `cv.imread` function returns None.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using an IDE other than jupyter notebook, the function `cv.imshow(window_name, image)` would display the image, (`window_name` is the name of the window to be displayed and `image` is an image array). But here, we'll use matplotlib's `imshow` function, which will view the image inside the notebook session itself. Now one thing to keep in mind is that OpenCV majorly deals with the BGR color format but matplotlib (which is used to here) deals with RGB images. Below is an image to show you how OpenCV deals with images as a 3D numpy array\n",
